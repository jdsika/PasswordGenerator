3) Start the program
4) You can generate an extended set of initial passwords from the ones in "2)". It will combine them in the different lengths from left to right and store them in "extended_initial_passwords.txt"
5) Generate all upper/lower combinations with a trainling "! / !! / !? / ?!" and store them to "resulting_passwords.txt"
6) The legths of the passwords my be changed in the code, also the names of the ".txt" files
